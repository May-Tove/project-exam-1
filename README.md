A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This was my project exam 1 where the goal was to put into practice the skills learned over my first year of studies.
The task was to create a blog site where we could choose the theme ourselfes. The site should have at least the following pages:

- Home page
- About page
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific pages
- Contact page.

The blog posts for the website is stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. The website itself is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data. The site has numerous functionalities built with JavaScript such as a carousel, image modal, contact form validation, search for blog poasts and filtering by category.

The project contained the following tasks:

- Decide on the theme for the blog youâ€™re going to make
- Create a prototype of the website
- Install WordPress on my web host and add the blogs on the admin panel.
- Build the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch my data.
- Install Hotjar on your website.
- Ask users to test the website, and adjust based on their feedback and any insights from Hotjar.
- Write a report documenting the project.
